# Draw It or Lose It – Java Game Service

This project was developed as part of CS 230 and focuses on designing a Java-based game service using object-oriented principles and common design patterns.

The goal of the project was to analyze system requirements and recommend an architecture that supports scalability, maintainability, and future growth.

## Project Overview
Draw It or Lose It is a game service concept designed to support multiple users and future distributed deployment. The project emphasizes clean structure and thoughtful design rather than a full graphical implementation.

## Key Concepts and Skills
- Java and object-oriented programming
- Design patterns, including:
  - Singleton pattern for shared resources
  - Iterator pattern for managing collections
- Basic system architecture planning
- Evaluating design trade-offs and constraints

## Design Decisions
This project focused on choosing appropriate patterns and structures to support:
- Controlled access to shared resources
- Maintainable and readable code
- Scalability for potential future expansion

Written documentation accompanies the code to explain design choices and architectural recommendations.

## What I Learned
- How to apply design patterns to real project requirements
- How architectural decisions impact scalability and maintainability
- How to communicate technical decisions clearly through documentation

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Design Principles
- UML and system design documentation

This project strengthened my understanding of software design and reinforced the importance of planning before implementation.
